    <h1>Alex Shillingford</h1>
    <p>Why am I known as the calm and peaceful one? The guy who can face tight
      timelines, deadlines, frustrated callers and chaos without missing a beat
      or even break a sweat? Because when I'm not working, I'm playing the guitar,
      writing music and giving music lessons to students who are as passionate
      about music as I am. Or maybe it's because I'm left-handed.</p>

    <p>With experience in Quality Assurance testing and automation for IOS
      applications at Anonyome Labs, as a Customer Service agent for Clearlink
      and as a Customer Service Advocate for Guitar Center, I've channeled these
      required skills into over 1,000 hours of study and practice into Swift,
      Objective-C and iOS/mobile development, including:</p>

    <h4>Swift:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Core Data</li>
      <li>Core Animation</li>
      <li>Networking Client/JSON Parsing</li>
      <li>Xcode Unit/UI Testing</li>
      <li>Cocoa Pods/Carthage/Third Party Library implementation</li>
      <li>UIKit</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Web Development:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>CSS3</li>
      <li>RESTful APIs</li>
      <li>Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Google Firebase</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All my experiences have required great passion, attention to detail,
      organizational expertise, excellent writing and communication skills and
      tight time management. I brought good, strong, required skills to each new
      position, and left with even greater adeptness, confidence, and in-demand
      skills to bring to the next job. I love learning and bringing creativity
      to everything in my work and life, working with product management and
      development team members, and getting nerdy with other developers on
      different layers.</p>

    <p>Musicians work hard and show great patience. Ask any musician.</p>
